# Roadmap (Planning-First)

This roadmap sequences the remaining **research and validation** so implementation can begin with minimal ambiguity.

## Near-term (next planning iteration)
1. Resolve P0 Open Questions (broker/account type, data provider semantics, universe symbols, venue+cutoffs).
2. Produce ADRs for the locked decisions.
3. Update Validation Matrix rows with **primary source links** and acceptance thresholds.
4. Expand operational readiness: restore drills, missed-run detection design, reconciliation tolerances.

## Medium-term
- Stage 0 completion (data QA + time-frontier tests)
- Stage 1 completion (robustness + PBO/CSCV gating)

## Long-term
- Stage 2 paper trading conformance plan
- Stage 3 small-capital live readiness
