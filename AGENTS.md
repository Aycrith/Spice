# Agent Operating Contract (for future implementation agents)

Any agent acting on this repository must:
1. Start with `docs/INDEX.md`.
2. Treat `docs/plan/PLAN_PROPOSAL_v2.1.md` and `docs/quality/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_v2.1.md` as authoritative.
3. Maintain traceability: every proposal must update `docs/validation/VALIDATION_MATRIX_v2.1.md` and `docs/validation/TRACEABILITY_INDEX_v2.1.md`.
4. Use ADRs for any architecturally significant decision. citeturn0search12turn0search0
5. Never introduce “intent drift.” Optional extensions must be explicitly labeled and gated.
