# Agent Operating Contract

This file is the minimal operating contract for any agent (human or AI) working in this repository.

## Non-negotiables

1. **No intent drift:** the MVP remains Cross-Asset Momentum Rotation (monthly).
2. **Planning-first:** until Stage 2 gates are passed, treat this repo as planning-only.
3. **Traceability:** any material change must map: Finding → Risk/GAP → Evidence/Example → Plan change → Validation method.
4. **No silent assumptions:** if unsure, log it in Open Questions with a resolution path.

## Required reading order

1. `docs/INDEX.md`
2. `docs/plan/PLAN_PROPOSAL_v2.1.md`
3. `docs/validation/VALIDATION_MATRIX_v2.1.md`
4. `docs/quality/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_v2.1.md`
5. `docs/ops/RUNBOOK_v2.1.md`

## Standard deliverable format for changes

For any update, include:
- What changed (file + section)
- Why (risk/gap)
- Evidence used (link to `docs/references/PRIMARY_SOURCES.md`)
- Validation method + acceptance threshold
- Traceability Index entry
