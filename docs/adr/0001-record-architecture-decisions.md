# 0001: Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-15

## Context
We need to record architecturally significant decisions that affect structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.

## Decision
We will maintain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in this repository under `docs/adr/`, using the Nygard-style structure.

## Consequences
- Decisions become discoverable, reviewable, and traceable.
- Strategy/architecture changes require explicit documentation and validation updates.
