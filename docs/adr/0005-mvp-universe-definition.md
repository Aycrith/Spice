# 0005: MVP universe definition

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-12-15

## Context
The MVP is cross-asset momentum rotation. A small ETF universe must balance:
- diversification across macro exposures
- sufficient liquidity
- long enough history for research
- tax and “substantially identical” boundaries

Universe selection affects robustness, implementation complexity, and wash sale risk.

## Decision (pending)
Define the initial ETF universe list and eligibility rules.

## Validation
- Minimum history and inception constraints enforced
- Liquidity thresholds (explicit)
- Cross-check for wash-sale adjacency risk
