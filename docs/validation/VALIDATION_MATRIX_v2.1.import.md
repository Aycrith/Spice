# Validation Matrix v2.1

This matrix links identified risks or gaps to the evidence that informs them,
the corresponding plan sections or changes, and the validation methods that
confirm the mitigation is effective.  Maintain this matrix as a living
document; every material change must update the appropriate row.

| Risk / Gap | Evidence (primary sources) | Plan section / change | Validation method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Missed closing auction deadlines** — orders entered too late could miss the auction or incur poor fills. | NYSE closing process: MOC/LOC orders must be entered by **3:50 PM**; cancellations restricted after **3:58 PM**【604093045262205†L93-L110】【826894920304809†L0-L53】. | Plan §1.3 mandates using MOC/LOC orders and submitting them by 3:50 PM ET on rebalance day. | Simulate monthly rebalances with mock orders; verify orders are sent before the cutoff.  Periodically review exchange rule updates. |
| **Settlement funding shortfall** — failure to deliver cash or securities by settlement date may trigger margin calls. | SEC/FINRA announce T+1 settlement cycle effective 28 May 2024; payment and securities are due on the next business day【634620779460672†L263-L320】【228845885160452†L154-L200】. | Plan §1.5 sets funding schedule: initiate transfers two days before rebalance; ensure cash is available one day before trade date. | Conduct dry runs of funding process; verify that cash is credited in the account before trade date.  Document lead times for ACH or wire transfers. |
| **Wash‑sale disallowed losses** — rotating into the same asset within 30 days of a loss sale can forfeit tax deductions. | IRS wash‑sale rule: selling a security at a loss and buying the same or substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale prohibits deducting the loss【774704392547939†L223-L239】; applies to stocks, bonds, ETFs and options【238476208366191†L190-L218】. | Plan §1.4 sets a minimum holding period of one month and avoids re‑entering identical ETFs within 30 days of a loss. | Backtest the strategy’s trades; flag any potential wash‑sale events.  Maintain a wash‑sale log and verify that the 30‑day window is respected. |
| **Model overfitting** — in‑sample performance may not generalise. | CSCV/PBO algorithm partitions data into subperiods; PBO measures the fraction of times the in‑sample winner underperforms the out‑of‑sample median【639029512866022†L454-L557】【639029512866022†L590-L618】. | Plan §1.6 requires computing PBO and rejecting models with **PBO > 0.05**.  Use CSCV to select lookback window and number of assets. | Implement CSCV on historical data; compute PBO.  Document results and confirm PBO below threshold. |
| **Momentum crash risk** — large negative returns during market rebounds. | Momentum strategies experience infrequent but severe crashes after market declines and when volatility is high【535019668254404†L50-L66】; exposures to high‑beta losers cause drawdowns【535019668254404†L92-L190】. | Plan §1.7 introduces risk mitigations: no shorting, cap position size at 60 %, maintain cash buffer, scale down during high volatility. | Backtest the strategy across historical crash periods (e.g., 2009).  Evaluate drawdowns with and without mitigations.  Update mitigations based on findings. |
| **Broker support for order types** — broker may not support MOC/LOC for certain ETFs. | Broker documentation (to be researched) and exchange rules. | Plan §2 (operational considerations) notes that broker support must be confirmed.  Add an open question if unclear. | Contact broker support or consult official docs; conduct a test order with small size.  Record results in the Traceability Index. |
| **Data quality issues** — incorrect or missing price data can affect rankings. | Primary data should include corporate actions and delistings; data provider docs. | Plan §2 instructs selection of a reliable data provider and defines data freeze time at 2:30 PM. | Validate data by cross‑checking against a secondary source.  Maintain automated sanity checks (e.g., returns within plausible bounds). |
| **Security of secrets** — leakage of API keys or credentials. | SECURITY.md: keep secrets in local files; never commit them; ensure auditability and incident response【813758299569681†L4-L22】. | Plan §2 emphasises adherence to SECURITY.md and logging. | Periodic security audits; confirm that no secrets are stored in the repository. |

## Process

1. When new evidence surfaces (e.g., updated settlement cycles), add a row to the matrix and link it to the plan.
2. For each risk, define a **validation method** that can be executed before deployment.
3. Maintain alignment with the **Traceability Index**, which cross‑references plan sections and evidence.
