# TRACEABILITY_INDEX v2.1

**Last updated:** 2025-12-15

Each item: Finding → Risk/GAP → Evidence/Example → Plan change → Validation.

1. Cutoff fragility near close → risk of late rejects → verify exchange/broker cutoffs → default Close→Open → paper cutoff compliance.
2. Lookahead bias hazard → inflated backtests → availability semantics tests → mandatory time-frontier policy → Stage 0 availability suite.
3. Overfitting risk → brittle parameters → CSCV/PBO gating → restrict search scope + decision locks → Stage 1 PBO report.
4. Momentum crash regimes → tail drawdowns → crash stress tests → explicit HALT/SAFE MODE linkage → stress + kill-switch drills.
5. Settlement realism (T+1) → cash sequencing failures → verify account rules → settlement gate in Stage 2–3 → paper constraints tests.
6. Wash sale exposure → reporting / tax impact → wash sale guidance review → lot awareness + flagging → detection simulation.
7. Strategy evidence baseline → insufficient rationale → literature-backed justification → explicit falsifiers + OOS gating → Stage 1–2 gates.
8. Repo governance hardening → unmanaged plan drift → docs-as-code + ADR practice + primary sources index → add GOVERNANCE/CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/AGENTS + PRIMARY_SOURCES + incident response playbook + agent workflow + stage status + PR template + CI guardrails → periodic doc QA gate (Stage 0).
9. No-cost proof-of-concept constraint → risk of Stage 2 blockers (broker/data costs) → sponsor instruction (2025-12-16) + cost constraint tracking → introduce Decision Portfolio Demo path (SimBroker + free/legal data) and keep broker selection open → demo determinism + replay checks; Stage 2 remains broker-conformance gate.
